// MARK: - Test Parallelism Optimization Recommendations

/*
 Swift Testing runs tests in parallel by default, which dramatically speeds up test execution.
 The .serialized trait should only be used when absolutely necessary.
 
 Current Status:
 - 4 test suites are marked as .serialized
 - Most of these don't appear to need serialization
 
 Recommendations:
 
 1. AIAnalysisServiceTests - Can likely run in parallel
    - Only tests data models and configurations
    - No shared mutable state
    - Recommendation: Remove .serialized
 
 2. CursorMonitorServiceTests - May need partial serialization
    - Tests monitoring services that might interact with system
    - Recommendation: Only serialize specific tests that need it
 
 3. InterventionEngineTests - Can likely run in parallel
    - Tests intervention logic without side effects
    - Recommendation: Remove .serialized
 
 4. ProcessMonitoringTests - May need serialization
    - Interacts with system processes
    - Recommendation: Keep .serialized or move to integration tests
 
 To optimize:
 1. Remove .serialized from test suites that don't need it
 2. Use .serialized only on specific test methods that require it
 3. Consider using test fixtures and dependency injection to avoid shared state
 4. Use actor isolation for truly shared resources
 
 Example refactoring:
 */

import Testing
@testable import CodeLooper

// Instead of serializing entire suite:
// @Suite("My Tests", .serialized)

// Serialize only specific tests that need it:
@Suite("My Tests")
struct OptimizedTests {
    // Most tests run in parallel
    @Test("Can run in parallel")
    func parallelTest1() { }
    
    @Test("Also parallel")
    func parallelTest2() { }
    
    // Only serialize tests that truly need it
    @Test("Needs serialization", .serialized)
    func serializedTest() {
        // Test that modifies shared system state
    }
}
