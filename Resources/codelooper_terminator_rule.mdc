# CodeLooper Terminator Rules

This rule set helps prevent infinite loops and provides safety mechanisms for code automation.

## Safety Rules

1. Always verify before making destructive changes
2. Limit the scope of automated operations
3. Include timeout mechanisms in loops
4. Add circuit breakers for recursive operations
