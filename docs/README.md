## About CodeLooper macOS App

The CodeLooper macOS app is a native menubar application that securely syncs your contacts with the CodeLooper service. It runs in the background, providing easy access to sync status and settings through a menu bar icon.

- **Menu Bar Integration**: Lightweight, unobtrusive menu bar app for status and control
- **Automatic Background Sync**: Configurable sync frequency with battery-aware operation
- **Secure Authentication**: OAuth-based secure authentication with Keychain integration
- **Privacy-Focused**: Clear permissions model and secure data handling

## Development Quick Start

1. Clone the repository
2. Run `pnpm install` from the project root to set up the project
3. Navigate to the `mac` directory
4. Run `./build.sh` to build the app

Key commands:

```bash
# Build the app
./build.sh

# Format and lint code
./lint.sh

# Run SwiftLint checks only
./run-swiftlint.sh

# Post binary information to a PR
./scripts/post-binary-info.sh --pr-number <PR_NUMBER>

# Set up git hooks (including pre-commit linting)
./setup-hooks.sh
```

## CI Features

- **Automated builds** on PRs and main branch commits
- **PR comments with artifact links** for easy testing of builds
- **Build status updates** directly in PR comments (success/failure)
- **Notarization status reporting** for production builds

For full CI/CD details, see [CI.md](CI.md).

## Logging and Diagnostics

The app uses Apple's swift-log framework for structured logging with multiple log levels. Logs are written to both console and rotating log files in the application support directory for troubleshooting.
