# Swift Code Analysis Guidelines

## Code Quality Enforcement

The CodeLooper macOS app utilizes strict code analysis settings to maintain high code quality and prevent common issues. These settings are enforced through a combination of compiler warnings, SwiftLint rules, and code review processes.

## Compiler Warning Configuration

- **Treat Warnings as Errors**: All warnings are treated as errors to ensure code quality
- **Strict Swift Concurrency**: Ensures proper usage of Swift's concurrency features
- **Strict Initialization**: Verifies all properties are properly initialized
- **Implicit Conversions**: Warns about implicit conversions that might lose precision
- **Explicit Nullability**: All nullable types must be explicitly marked
- **Memory Safety**: Static analyzer checks for memory management issues

## Swift Best Practices

### Avoid Force Unwrapping

Force unwrapping (`!`) should be avoided in all production code. Instead use:

- Optional binding (`if let`, `guard let`)
- Optional chaining
- Nil coalescing operator (`??`)
- `assertionFailure()` or `fatalError()` for programmer errors with clear messages

### Proper Error Handling

- Use Swift's native error handling with `do`/`catch`
- Provide descriptive error messages and types
- Consider the user experience when handling recoverable errors
- Log appropriate information for debugging

### Thread Safety

- Use Swift concurrency (`async`/`await`) for asynchronous operations
- Explicitly document thread assumptions for methods and properties
- Use proper synchronization (like `os_unfair_lock` or `DispatchQueue`) when needed
- Prefer value types for thread safety

## Static Analysis Tools

The project utilizes several static analysis tools:

1. **Xcode Analyzer**: Built-in static analyzer enabled with maximum sensitivity
2. **SwiftLint**: Custom rule set for coding style and potential bugs
3. **Thread Sanitizer**: To detect potential threading issues
4. **Address Sanitizer**: To detect memory issues

## Analyzer CI Checks

Analyzer issues are reported in continuous integration and must be fixed before merging:

- New code must have zero warnings
- Memory leaks detected by the analyzer must be fixed
- Potential thread safety issues must be resolved
