# Code Signing Configuration Example for CodeLooper
# Copy this file to .codesign-config and update with your signing identities
# This ensures consistent code signing across builds to prevent TCC permission issues

# Use Apple Development certificate for local development builds
# This prevents TCC database thrashing that occurs with ad-hoc or changing signatures
# Find your identity with: security find-identity -v -p codesigning | grep "Apple Development"
DEVELOPMENT_SIGNING_IDENTITY="Apple Development: Your Name (TEAMID)"

# Use Developer ID for distribution builds
# Find your identity with: security find-identity -v -p codesigning | grep "Developer ID"
DISTRIBUTION_SIGNING_IDENTITY="Developer ID Application: Your Name (TEAMID)"

# Default signing identity (used when BUILD_TYPE is not specified)
DEFAULT_SIGNING_IDENTITY="$DEVELOPMENT_SIGNING_IDENTITY"
