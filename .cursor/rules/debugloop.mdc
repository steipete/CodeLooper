# Debug Loop: Interacting with Cursor's Input Field via Accessibility

This document tracks the strategy and learnings for programmatically finding and interacting with the main text input field in the Cursor application (the "Search, build anything..." prompt) using accessibility tools.

## 1. Goal

The primary objective is to:
1.  Identify the accessibility element representing Cursor's main chat/prompt input field.
2.  Programmatically set focus to this field.
3.  Programmatically enter text into this field.
4.  (Future) Programmatically trigger the "send" action for the entered text.
5.  (Future) Cache the path or a stable identifier to this element for faster future access.

## 2. Target Application: Cursor

-   **Bundle Identifier:** `com.todesktop.230313mzl4w4u92`

## 3. Obtaining Cursor's Process ID (PID)

-   **Method:** AppleScript executed via `mcp_automator_execute_script`.
-   **Status:** Successful.
-   **Example PID Obtained:** `5248` (Note: This PID is dynamic and will change with each application launch).
-   **AppleScript:**
    ```applescript
    tell application "System Events"
        try
            set appProcesses to every application process whose bundle identifier is "com.todesktop.230313mzl4w4u92"
            if (count of appProcesses) > 0 then
                set appProcess to first item of appProcesses
                return unix id of appProcess
            else
                return "Error: Application with bundle ID com.todesktop.230313mzl4w4u92 not found."
            end if
        on error errMsg number errNum
            return "AppleScript Error: " & errMsg & " (Number: " & errNum & ")"
        end try
    end tell
    ```

## 4. Accessibility Exploration: `axorc` CLI Tool

-   **Tool:** `axorc`, the command-line interface for the `AXorcist` library.
-   **Invocation:** `swift run --package-path AXorcist axorc [axorc_arguments...]` (from workspace root `/Users/steipete/Projects/CodeLooper`).
-   **Status:** Successfully invoked.
-   **JSON Command Input:** `axorc` expects commands via a JSON payload, e.g., using the `--json` argument.
    -   **Decoder Issue (Locator):** The `locator` object in the JSON command requires a `criteria` field (e.g., `"criteria": {}`), even if `type` is `"application"` and criteria might seem redundant. Failure to provide this results in a JSON decoding error (`keyNotFound: criteria`).
    -   **Decoder Issue (OutputFormat):** The `outputFormat` field in the `CommandEnvelope` (used by `collectAll`) does not accept the string `"json"` directly. Omitting the field works and seems to default to a JSON output for `collectAll`.
    -   **Application Targeting:** Using `"application": "pid:<PID>"` resulted in "Application not found". Using `"application": "<BUNDLE_ID>"` (e.g., `"com.todesktop.230313mzl4w4u92"`) works correctly.

-   **Successful `collectAll` command to list top-level app elements:**
    ```json
    {
      "commandId": "cmd_collect_all_windows_005",
      "command": "collectAll",
      "application": "com.todesktop.230313mzl4w4u92",
      "locator": {
        "type": "application",
        "criteria": {}
      },
      "maxDepth": 1,
      "attributes": ["kAXRoleAttribute", "kAXTitleAttribute", "kAXIdentifierAttribute", "kAXSubroleAttribute", "kAXFocusedAttribute", "kAXEnabledAttribute", "kAXSizeAttribute", "kAXPositionAttribute"]
    }
    ```
    **Invocation:**
    ```bash
    swift run --package-path AXorcist axorc --json '{"commandId": "cmd_collect_all_windows_005", ..., "kAXPositionAttribute"]}'
    ```
    **Result:** Successfully listed top-level elements (application, windows, menu bar). However, the requested attributes (e.g., `kAXRoleAttribute`, `kAXTitleAttribute`) were returned as `null` in the `collectAll` output, though `ComputedName` was present.

## 5. Next Steps for Exploration

1.  **Investigate Attribute Fetching:** Determine why `collectAll` returns `null` for requested attributes. Options:
    *   Try the `getAttributes` command on a specific window element identified by its path from the `collectAll` output (e.g., `window 0`, `window 1`).
    *   Use `describeElement` on a specific window element.
    *   Check if the attributes in the `collectAll` command's `attributes` array need to be prefixed (e.g., `AXRoleAttribute` instead of `kAXRoleAttribute`) or if different attribute constants should be used for querying via `axorc` vs. direct Swift/AX API calls.

2.  **Identify Main Chat Window:** From the `collectAll` output, determine which window corresponds to the main Cursor interface containing the chat/prompt area. This might be based on title or by exploring its children further.

3.  **Explore Window Hierarchy:** Once the main window is identified (e.g., as `window 0` or `window 1` from the perspective of `axorc` if it uses 0-based indexing for children), query its children recursively using `collectAll` or `query` with increased `maxDepth`.
    ```json
    // Example: Explore children of the first window
    {
      "commandId": "explore_window_0_children",
      "command": "collectAll", // or "query"
      "application": "com.todesktop.230313mzl4w4u92",
      "locator": {
        "type": "path", // Or another suitable locator type for a specific window
        "path": ["application", "window 0"] // Placeholder - actual path format TBD
      },
      "maxDepth": 5, // Or adjust as needed
      "attributes": ["kAXRoleAttribute", "kAXTitleAttribute", "kAXIdentifierAttribute", "kAXPlaceholderValueAttribute", "kAXValueAttribute", "kAXDescriptionAttribute"]
    }
    ```
    Look for roles `AXTextArea`, `AXTextField`, etc., and relevant placeholder/value attributes.

4.  **Refine Path & Identify Target Element.**
5.  **Test Interaction (CLI).**
6.  **Verify with Peekaboo.**

## 6. Future Steps (Integration into CodeLooper)

-   Translate successful `axorc` commands into `AXorcist` Swift library calls.
-   Develop a robust method for locating the target element.
-   Implement path/identifier caching if feasible.


# AXORC Debug Loop & Learnings (Session 2)

## Goal: Find and interact with Cursor's main input field

## Key Learnings & `axorc`/`AXorcist` Improvements:

1.  **`AnyCodable.swift` Enhancements (AXorcist Core):**
    *   Successfully added handlers to `AnyCodable.swift` to correctly serialize various previously problematic attribute types into JSON:
        *   `CGPoint`: Encoded as `{"x": ..., "y": ...}`
        *   `CGSize`: Encoded as `{"width": ..., "height": ...}`
        *   `CGRect`: Encoded as `{"x": ..., "y": ..., "width": ..., "height": ...}`
        *   `NSURL`: Encoded as its `absoluteString`.
        *   Opaque `__NSCFType` instances (wrapping types like `AXUIElementRef`, `AXTextMarkerRef`): Encoded using their `String(describing: value)`, e.g., `"<AXUIElement ...>"`.
    *   This dramatically improved the reliability and completeness of JSON output from `axorc` commands like `query` and `collectAll`.

2.  **`axorc` JSON Command Structure Insights & Quirks:**
    *   **Mandatory `criteria`:** When defining a `locator` in a command, even if `type` is `"application"` or `"path"`, an empty `criteria: {}` object is currently required. Omitting it causes a JSON decoding error in `axorc`. (Improvement target for `axorc`).
    *   **`outputFormat` field:** Earlier issues with `outputFormat: "json"` seem resolved or less prevalent after `AnyCodable` fixes. Best practice is often to omit it and let `axorc` use its default (which is JSON).

3.  **Strategies for Targeting Elements:**
    *   **`locator.type: "firstMatch"`:** This is currently the most reliable method for targeting specific elements using a dictionary of `criteria` (e.g., `{"AXRole": "AXWebArea", "AXTitle": "window_title"}`).
    *   **`locator.type: "path"`:** This remains problematic. The exact string format required for path segments (e.g., `"role:AXRole,AXTitle:SomeTitle"`) and the resolution logic within `AXorcist` (likely involving `PathHintComponent.swift`) needs further investigation and potential fixes. Current attempts to use it often default to an application-wide search.
    *   **`collectAll` for Exploration:** Using `collectAll` with a `locator` for a known parent element (like an `AXWebArea`) and a sufficient `maxDepth` (e.g., 5-7) is effective for dumping a large portion of the UI tree for inspection. Ensure the initial `locator` for the parent is correct and specific.

4.  **Cursor Application Specifics (Observations):**
    *   Window titles (e.g., `"agent.mdc â€” claude-code-mcp"`) are crucial for targeting elements within a specific Cursor window. These titles can change based on the open file/tab.
    *   The main content area within a Cursor window is typically an `AXWebArea` which often shares the same `AXTitle` as its parent `AXWindow`.
    *   Identifying the main chat input field via `AXPlaceholderValue` proved difficult (exact value unknown, partial matches failed). It's likely necessary to find it by its `AXRole` (e.g., `AXTextArea`, `AXTextField`, or a custom web role) in conjunction with other attributes (`AXIdentifier`, `AXDOMIdentifier`, `AXDescription`) or its structural position within the `AXWebArea`. Manual inspection of comprehensive `collectAll` output is the current best approach.

5.  **Debugging Workflow for `axorc` and Accessibility:**
    *   When `axorc` JSON output fails or is incomplete, suspect `AnyCodable` issues. Add debug prints in `AnyCodable.swift` to identify unhandled types, then add specific handlers for them.
    *   Verify locators: Before using a complex locator in `collectAll` or `performAction`, test it with a simple `query` command to ensure it correctly identifies the intended element.
    *   If a `locator` for a specific element (e.g., `AXWebArea` with a certain title) fails, it might be because the element's properties (like title) have changed in the target application. Re-discover the element's current properties (e.g., list all windows to get current titles).

## Next Steps for Original Goal:

1.  Generate a full UI tree dump of the relevant Cursor window's `AXWebArea` using `collectAll` and save it to a file (e.g., `cursor_ui_tree.json`).
    ```json
    // Example collectAll command for this:
    {
      "commandId": "collect_full_webarea_for_inspection",
      "command": "collectAll",
      "application": "com.todesktop.230313mzl4w4u92",
      "locator": {
        "type": "firstMatch",
        "criteria": { "AXRole": "AXWebArea", "AXTitle": "CURRENT_CURSOR_WINDOW_TITLE" }
      },
      "maxDepth": 7, // Adjust as needed
      "requestedAttributes": [/* Comprehensive list including kAXChildrenAttribute */]
    }
    ```
2.  Manually inspect `cursor_ui_tree.json` to find the chat input element and its unique, stable attributes.
3.  Use these attributes in a `query` to confirm, then in `performAction` to interact (set focus, set value).

## Planned `axorc`/`AXorcist` Improvements:

*   Fix `AXElementLocator` decoding in `axorc` to make `criteria: {}` truly optional for `path` and `application` locator types.
*   Enhance `AXElementMatcher.swift` in `AXorcist` to support flexible string matching (e.g., "contains", "startsWith") for criteria values.
*   Further investigate and stabilize `locator.type: "path"` functionality.

## AXorcist PathNavigator Debugging Log (Session from 2025-05-25)

**Goal:** Fix `PathNavigator.swift` failing to navigate to a target window (e.g., `Role:AXWindow,PID:5248,Title:...`). Error: "Failed to navigate to path...".

**Key Challenge:** Intermittent / missing `axDebugLog` output in critical code sections, hampering direct observation of control flow and variable states.

**Timeline & Findings:**

1.  **Initial State & Problem Scope**:
    *   `processPathComponent` (PPC) is entered for the app element and the window's path component string.
    *   The failure occurs when PPC tries to find a matching child via `findMatchingChild` (FMIC) or when `elementMatchesAllCriteria` (EMAC) fails for all children or the current element.

2.  **The "Missing Logs" Mystery**:
    *   `axDebugLog` calls placed immediately before calling FMIC (in PPC) and at the absolute entry of FMIC were consistently *not* appearing in the final JSON `debugLogs`.
    *   Logs *before* this point in PPC (e.g., `logPathComponentProcessing`) and *after* this critical section (e.g., `logNoMatchFound` in PPC if FMIC returned nil and EMAC on current element also failed) *were* appearing.
    *   **Hypothesis Developed**: `axDebugLog` (defined in `LoggingHelpers.swift`) wraps its actual logging operation (`await GlobalAXLogger.shared.log(entry)`) in an unstructured `Task { ... }`. If the main execution thread of `axorc` proceeded too quickly through the section of code where logs were missing (especially if FMIC returned `nil` rapidly), these detached logging `Task`s might not get scheduled or complete before the program/command finished or the log buffer for the current command was finalized. This could lead to lost log messages.

3.  **Debugging `axDebugLog` Behavior**:
    *   **Experiment: Synchronous Navigation (Attempt 1)**:
        *   Made FMIC, `getChildrenFromElement` (GCFE), and their internal calls to `Element.children()` synchronous by removing `async/await`.
        *   This did *not* make the missing logs appear and did not fix the navigation failure.
        *   These changes were reverted to restore `async/await`.
    *   **Experiment: Diagnostic Delays (Attempt 2 - Current State)**:
        *   Added `Thread.sleep(forTimeInterval: 0.1)` immediately *after* the `axDebugLog` calls that were previously not appearing:
            *   In PPC, after the log just before calling FMIC.
            *   In FMIC, after its absolute entry log.
        *   The purpose is to give the detached logging `Task`s a brief window to execute.
        *   The outcome of this experiment is pending the next `axorc` execution.

4.  **State of `PathNavigator.swift` for Next Test Run**:
    *   Full `async/await` structure is restored in PPC, FMIC, GCFE.
    *   The call to `await elementMatchesAllCriteria(...)` within FMIC's loop is active.
    *   The aforementioned `Thread.sleep(forTimeInterval: 0.1)` calls are in place.
    *   Extensive "stepCounter" logs have been added throughout PPC to trace its execution flow minutely.

**Next Step:** Execute `axorc` with the current `PathNavigator.swift` (containing sleeps and step counters). Analyze the output logs to:
1.  See if the previously missing `axDebugLog` calls now appear due to the `Thread.sleep` delays.
2.  Follow the `stepCounter` logs in PPC to understand exactly where it might be exiting prematurely or behaving unexpectedly if navigation still fails.
3.  If logs appear, use them to diagnose the core navigation logic failure within FMIC or EMAC for the target window criteria.


# AXorcist & axorc Debugging Session Learnings (Continued - Session 3)

This document summarizes the key findings, issues, and solutions discovered during an extensive debugging session for the `AXorcist` framework and its command-line tool, `axorc`, focusing on achieving reliable debug logging output.

## 1. Goal
Enable and verify the `debugLogging: true` functionality in `axorc` commands to include detailed `debugLogs` in the JSON output, which is crucial for diagnosing UI element location issues.

## 2. Initial Problem & Symptoms
-   Setting `"debugLogging": true` in the JSON payload for `axorc` commands did not result in the `debugLogs` array appearing in the JSON output.
-   Diagnostic `fputs` statements added to `CommandExecutor.swift` and intended for `stderr` were not visible in the output from `run_terminal_cmd`, making it difficult to trace the flow of the `debugLogging` flag.

## 3. Key Steps & Resolutions

### 3.1. Ensuring Code Changes Were Compiled and Run
-   **Problem:** Uncertainty whether modifications to `AXorcist` or `axorc` sources were being included in the executed `axorc` binary.
-   **Solution:**
    -   Adopted `swift package clean` to ensure a fresh build state.
    -   Specifically built the `axorc` product using `swift build --product axorc`. This was a critical step, as a general `swift build` from the root `CodeLooper` project did *not* reliably rebuild the `axorc` tool.
    -   This revealed previously hidden build errors in `axorc` and dependent packages (`AXpector`, `CodeLooper` itself) that were masked by stale builds.

### 3.2. Fixing `CommandEnvelope.debugLogging` Handling
-   **Problem:** The `debugLogging` field in `CommandEnvelope` (defined in `AXorcist/Sources/AXorcist/Core/CommandModels.swift`) was optional, potentially leading to inconsistent handling.
-   **Solution:**
    -   Changed `debugLogging` to be a non-optional `Bool` in `CommandEnvelope`, providing a default value of `false` in its `init(from decoder: Decoder)` and its memberwise initializer.
    -   Updated `CommandExecutor.swift` in `axorc` to reflect that `command.debugLogging` is now non-optional. This simplified conditions like `shouldIncludeLogs = debugCLI || command.debugLogging`.

### 3.3. Resolving Build Errors Caused by `debugLogging` Change & `pathHint` Removal
-   **Problem:** Making `debugLogging` non-optional (and a prior refactor that removed an unused `pathHint` parameter from `AXorcist` public methods) caused a cascade of build failures in:
    -   `AXpector/Sources/AXpector/ViewModelExtensions/AXpectorViewModel+AttributeEditing.swift`
    -   `Sources/Supervision/CursorInterventionEngine.swift`
    -   Multiple files in `Sources/Utilities/Accessibility/`
-   **Solution:** Systematically fixed these build errors by:
    -   Ensuring all instantiations of `CommandEnvelope` correctly handled the now non-optional `debugLogging` (though this was largely covered by the default value in `CommandEnvelope`'s decoder).
    -   Removing the extraneous `pathHint: nil` argument from all calls to `axorcist.handleQuery(...)` and `axorcist.handlePerformAction(...)` across the affected files. The `mcp_agent_claude_code` tool was used to batch-fix files in `Sources/Utilities/Accessibility/`.

### 3.4. Correcting Type Errors in `axorc`'s `CommandExecutor.swift`
-   **Problem:** After focusing the build on `axorc` (via `swift build --product axorc`), type errors emerged in `CommandExecutor.swift`:
    -   `'Element' is not a member type of class 'AXorcist.AXorcist'` and `Value of type 'Any?' has no member 'underlyingElement'` in `executeSetFocusedValue`.
-   **Solution:**
    -   The type `AXorcist.Element` (from the `AXorcist` library module) is imported as `Element` into `CommandExecutor.swift`. The cast was corrected from `as? AXorcist.Element` to `as? Element`.
    -   Ensured that `raw.underlyingElement` was accessed on a correctly typed `Element` instance.
    -   Removed an unused `logsToInclude` variable in `handlePerformActionCommand`.

### 3.5. Reliable Command Execution and Path Issues
-   **Problem:** Running `axorc` via `./temp_axorc_runner.sh` sometimes failed with `no such file or directory: .build/debug/axorc`, even after successful builds.
-   **Solution:**
    -   The shell script `temp_axorc_runner.sh` was modified to explicitly `cd` to its own directory (`SCRIPT_DIR=$(cd -- "$(dirname -- "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}")" &> /dev/null && pwd); cd "$SCRIPT_DIR" || exit 1`) before attempting to execute `.build/debug/axorc`. This resolved relative path issues when the script was called from different working directories.
    -   Using `ls -l .build/debug/axorc` helped confirm when the executable was genuinely missing, often pointing back to incomplete or incorrect build commands (e.g., not using `--product axorc`).

### 3.6. Restoring Debug Output
-   **Success:** After all the above fixes were in place, and `axorc` was built correctly with `swift build --product axorc` and executed via the properly configured `temp_axorc_runner.sh`:
    -   The `fputs` diagnostic messages (e.g., `CommandExecutor.setupLogging: Received command.debugLogging = true`) started appearing in the `run_terminal_cmd` output's `stderr`.
    -   Crucially, the `debugLogs: [...]` array finally appeared in the JSON output when `debugLogging: true` was specified in the command.

## 4. Current Status & Next Steps for UI Element Location
-   The `debugLogging` mechanism in `axorc` is now functional.
-   However, the initial queries for `AXTextArea` or `AXRoleDescription` with regex like `~regex:(text entry|chat input|message input)` still do not find the Cursor chat input field.
-   The extensive debug logs now available will be instrumental in analyzing the UI tree traversal and understanding why these specific criteria are not matching. The next step is to re-run these queries, capture the full debug logs, and meticulously examine them to refine the locator criteria.

This concludes the summary of the `debugLogging` saga.

# Session 4: Successful Interaction via Simulated User Input (Claude Code MCP)

## Goal Revisited
Reliably set the text of Cursor's main chat input field and ensure it's visually present and persistent.

## Problem with Direct `AXSetValue`
Previous attempts using `axorc performAction AXSetValue` (targeting `kAXValueAttribute`) consistently failed to make the text *visually appear or persist* in the Cursor chat input, even when `axorc` reported API-level success. The leading hypothesis was that Cursor's UI (likely web-based) was not correctly responding to or was immediately overwriting direct accessibility value changes. Subsequent `query` commands often failed to find the element or reported its `AXValue` as empty or unchanged.

## Solution: Simulated User Input via Claude Code MCP

-   **Strategy:** Escalate the task to `mcp_agent_claude_code` with a detailed prompt explaining the objective and the failures of direct accessibility manipulation.
-   **Claude Code MCP Prompt Highlights:**
    -   Target: Cursor application (bundle ID `com.todesktop.230313mzl4w4u92`).
    -   Action: Set chat input to "Hello from Claude Code!".
    -   Guidance: Prioritize methods simulating user input (typing, pasting) due to `AXSetValue` issues.
    -   Verification: Ensure text is visibly present.
-   **Result:** **SUCCESSFUL.**
    -   Claude Code reported that the most reliable method was a **clipboard paste approach combined with the Cmd+K shortcut** to ensure the input field was focused.
    -   The sequence:
        1.  Activate Cursor.
        2.  Send `Cmd+K` to focus the chat input.
        3.  Send `Cmd+A` to select all (clear existing text).
        4.  Set clipboard to "Hello from Claude Code!".
        5.  Send `Cmd+V` to paste.
-   **Key Takeaway:** For applications with complex or web-based UIs that don't fully honor direct accessibility API value changes, simulating user input (focus, keyboard shortcuts, pasteboard operations) is a more robust strategy. `AXorcist` alone, which focuses on direct AX API calls, may not suffice in these scenarios. This suggests a potential area for future enhancement or complementary tooling.

## Conclusion for Original Goal
The immediate goal of setting text in the Cursor chat input has been achieved by leveraging Claude Code MCP's capabilities to simulate user input. This workaround bypasses the observed limitations with `axorc`'s direct `AXSetValue` approach for this specific target application.
